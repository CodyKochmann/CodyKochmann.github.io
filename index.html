<p>I would start this page with a story about where I came from and how I got here but, I don't remember much before the year 2012. (another story for another time). What I can tell you now is what I've done ever since my memory began.</p>

<p>I slowly became a student computer scientist (now specializing in artificial intelligence and cognitive neuroscience). I have a passion for learning and love applying everything that I learn, from the core elements up, to create tools that will help people on a daily basis.</p>

<p>While I continue studying, I am working as a software engineer creating apps, databases, computer clusters, anything that implements intelligence to create a seamless solution.</p>

<p>Currently, I am traveling with my wife and son as she serves in the United States Air Force. While on this journey together, we aim to do as much as we can to leave this world a better place than it was before.</p>
